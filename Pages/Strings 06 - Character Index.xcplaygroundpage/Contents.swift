/*:
 Formally, Strings are both **BidirectionalCollections** and **RangeReplaceableCollections**. This means that we donâ€™t have to ask the *source* String for its Characters, we can just fast enumerate *source* directly and *c* is inferred to be a Character:
 */

}

//: ## Character Index
/*:
 Because a String is a collection, we can also apply one sided ranges to a String. Here we find the index of a Character and use a one sided range to pull out the Characters prior to but not including that Character. This makes parsing Strings much nicer:
